### Financial system 
- main function: the transfer of funds between the present. and the future
    - 用于交易 financial assets (saving account ,mortgae...)
- saler is the borrower, buyer is the lender 
- A security is a **finianical asset** that can be **trade in financial market** and that include  **stock and bonnds**.
- The institutionn in financial system :
    - The payment system (emt,cheque,debit, card or cash...)
    - Central bank annd regulatory agencies
    - finiancial market (drect trade stock and bonds)
    - financiial intermediaries(bank ,agency: indirect trade)
- **Diff.** between **saving** and **investment** 
    - saving: buy a financial asset
    - investment: buy a prodctive physicial asset
### Risk and liquidity
- disadvantage of financiall asset  without finiacial market 
    - **Risk** : unpredictability of future payments 
        - shocks to borrower's future income 
        - incmplete info about the borrower
    - **liquidity**: ease of converting asset into cashh 
        - trascation cost 
    - **matchng borrowers and lender** 
        - individuals not aware of all possible opptunities for borrowering and lending
        - incomplete info about the borrower
- The solution
    - diversificationn : splitting of wealth among many different assets to reduce risk(鸡蛋不要放在一个篮子里)
    - financial system 
        - provide the info of borrower  to reduced the risk 
        - provision of liquidity
            - allows people trade without physical asset
            - providing infomation als increase liquidity
        - using financial markets or financial intermediaries to match the borrower and lender
	- **diff. between financial intermediates and markets**
		- 
### 3. financial market
- primary market : financial markets where stocks, bonds and other securities are sld foor first time.
- secondary market: financial markets where traders buy or sell existinng seccurities（二手市场）
#### bond market
-    a debt security that promises to make payments periodically  fr a specified period of time 
- The price of bond reflect:
    - the value of promise payments
    - the probability that payments will actually be made 
- interest rate features
    - short-term bonds / safer bonds have low interest rates
    - the spreads between them fluctuate
- <span id=“discount_bond”><b>Discount bond</b> </span>
    - debt instrument
    - present value < future value
    - single payment at maturity 
- <span id=“coupon”><b>Coupon bond</b> </span>
    - debt instrument
    - multiple payments bond 
    - Coupon: the annual fixed dollar amount of interest paid by the issuer of the bod to the buyer
    - `!$ coupon \  rate=\frac{coupon}{Face \ value} $`
- **Yield of Maturity** 
	- 债卷的整体年均回报率,中途没有转卖
	- let PV= Price
	- yield < 市场利率 →不应该投资
	- One year discount bond :
		- `!$\frac{F}{1+i}=P$`
		- i: discount yield to matiurity 
		- F : face value 
		- P : current price  of the discount bond
		- `!$i=\frac{F}{P}-1=\frac{F-P}{P}$`
		-  i and bond price have negative relationship
	-  Coupon bonds
		-   `!$General \ price= \sum_1^T \frac{coupon}{(1+i)^T}+\frac{F}{(1+i)^T} $` 
		-   coupon bond price 
			-   = face value , the YTM = coupon rate
			-   < face value, the YTM > coupon rate
			-   \> face value, the YTM < coupon rate 
-   **risk** 
	-    interest-rate risk 
		-    financial asset 价格波动的risk
	-    default risk
		-  不还钱的风险
		-  gov. bond default risk < firm bond default risk
-  **rate of return**
	-  投资一年的回报
	-  one period discount bond without default risk
		-  `!$R= \frac{F-P}{P}=YTM$`
			-  没有interest rate risk
	-  Multi period bond 
		-  multi period coupon bond return= the coupon + the resale price of  the bond next year
		-  价格变动产生的利润/损失： capital gain/loss
		-  realized capital gain / loss : 债券卖出之后
		-  `!$Rate \ of  \ return = Currennt\ yield + rate\ of\ capital\ gain$`
		-  `!$R= \frac{coupon}{price}+\frac{P_{t+1}-P_t}{P_t}$`
-  **Bond market equilibrium**
	-  Demand side 
		-  factors affect demand
			-   Wealth (+)
			-   Expected return(+)
			-   Risk (-)
			-   Liquidity(+)
			-   international capital inflows(+)
			-   expected inflation(-)(at start point)
		-   The price and quantity demanded are **negatively** related 
			-   reason: **asset returns are reduced by higher asset prices**
	-  Supply side 
		-  determinded in primary market 
		-  factor affect supply
			-  Gov. budget deficit (+)
			   budget deficit→ gov need borrow →supply ↑
			-  Investment opportunities(+)
			  economic growth/expansion →公司做项目机会多→借钱投资
			  → supply↑
			-  Expected real cost of borrowing (-)
				-  π_e increase, 在初期，i constant，real interest  rate decrease
				-  借钱成本下降→多借钱
			-  international capital flows(+),海外机构借钱
		-  the price and the quantity are **positive** related because **the cost of funds is reduced by higher asset prices**
-  **interest rate decrease during the recessions**
	-  econnomic downturn`!$\rightarrow$` expected income `!$\downarrow$` ,wealth `!$\downarrow$` `!$\rightarrow$` demand shift left,price decrease
	-  supply shift right: lower expectd productivity --> profit decrease--> bond price rise
	-  `!$\Delta D < \Delta S$`
	-  bond price rise in a recession 
-  interest rate prdict inflation 
	-  `!$\pi_e \uparrow$` --> at start point ,D &S don't change, r decrease, i constant
	-   then,demand cure shift to left,supply curve shift to right
	-  after that, P decrease, i increase
-  **Fisher effect**
	-  `!$r \approxeq i- \pi^e$` 
		-  assume r is fixed ,then change in nominal interest rate must match exactly any changes in the expected inflation rate
	-  Higher  **expected inflation rates**  --> higher nominal interest rates 
	-  changes in epected inflation rates--> chages in nomical interest rates **before a change in actual inflation occurs** 
#### stock market
- a share of ownership in a corporation 
- the price of stock reflects he current value of the corporation
- common stock 
    - entitles the owner to a vote at share-holder meetings of the corporation
        - amount of dividend fluctuates
        - a share of assets remainig. after bankruptcy
        - shareholder are not personally liable fr a corporation's debt
- preferred stock
    - non-voting security  (gives no voting right to shareholder)
    - a fixd rate of dividents must paid before any payments are made o common stock 
- stock trading 
    - stock exchange 
    - over the counter market
    - IPO: 上市
- **share value**
	- `!$r_E$`: required  rate of return 
		- 最低的投资股票回报率
		- equity cost of capital
		- `!$re=present\ value + equity\ premium$` 
		- equity premium: 股票回报率 - other  asset  return rate 
		- why stock have hiher return rate?
			- stock has **systematic risk**
				- 股票市场的巨大波动
			-  stock has **Idiosyncratic risk**
				-  公司自己的风险（公共危机,etc.）
- **Stock Value**
	- `!$D^e_{t+1}$` = the dividend paid ar the end of year 1
	- `!$P^e_{t+1}$`= the resale price  at the end of year 1
	- stock current price : `!$P_t=\frac{D_{t+1}^e}{1+r_E}+\frac{P_{t+1}^e}{1+r_E}$`
	- `!$R=r_E=$` the ecpected rate of return
	- `!$\frac{D^e_{t+1}}{P_t}$` :dividend yield
	- Fundamental value of a stock （一直持有）
	   `!$P_t=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{D_{t+k}}{(1+r_E)^k}$`
	- Gorden growth model
		-  assume stock's dividend increase at growth rate **g**
		-  `!$P_t= D_{t+k} \times \frac{1+g}{(r_E-g)}$`
-  **models of expectations** 
		-  `!$P_{t+1}=P^e_{t+1}+ \epsilon_{t+1}$`
		-  Adaptive expectations 
			-  expectations are based on past experience only
			-  slow to adjust to news
		-  Rational expectations
			-  expectations are based on all available information
			-  **instantaneous adjustment** to reliable news about future trends
### Money 
- currency is a good or an asset
	- a menas of payment in the ceonomy 
- Income : a flow of funds to a household or a firm
- wealth is the sum of the value of a person's assets -liabilities
- **core functions of money**  
	- Medium of exchange 
		- effective medium of exchange
			- easily standardized
			- widely acepted
			- divisible
			- easy to carry
			- not deteriorate quickly
	- Unit of account 
	- store of value
- Fiat currency : currency has **no intrinsic** values and carries a **zero interest** rate  
	- why accept ?
		- widely accept fiat currency as a means of payment
		- legal tender laws
- Commodity money： has intrinsic values , eg. gold ,sliver etc
####  payment system 
- Canada payment system
	- LVTS(Lynx)
		- large-value transfer system
	- ACSS ted clearing settlement system
- Measure of Money supply
	- Canadian's Monetary aggregates
		- M1+: currency + chequable deposits
		- M2：M1+ fixed-term deposits
		- M2+:M2+ deposits at TMLs and CUCPs
		- M2+\+: M2+ + certain retail debt instruments
		- M3:M2+ non-personal term deposits + foreign currency bank deposits
	- In SR, M1 and M2 can mover in different direction.
		- variation over time in d&S of each type of financial asset 
		- a rise in interest-rate spreads raise the relative cost of hoding asset that are less liquid, risker or longer-term
	- in LR, these aggregates tend to move in same direction 
		- demand for different financial assets reflects relatively peranent features of the economy 
		- preferences, financial structure, economic policy
	- real effect of MS
		- reduce unemployment and increase GDP in SR
  #### Digital currency
 - **Bank E money**
	 - electronic money issued by banks or other firms 
	 - transactors trust the issuer to solve the double-spend problem
		 - double-spend problem:买了还没付钱
	 - not permissionless
		 - has to apply to the issuer for an account
		 - not censorship-resistant: 不是特别自由
 - **Crptocurrency**
	 - a digtial or virual currency that functions as a medium of echane
	 - transactions are processed in a computerized ledger known as the **blockchain**
	 - without the need for chartered and central banks 
	 - permissionless
	 - censirship-resistant
		 - spend it as you fee fit
	 - 货币越不稳定的地方越喜欢比特币
 - **Stablecoins**
	 - asset-backed cryptocurrencies
	 - "backed" by safe assests such as US currency or Treasury bonds
 - **CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCY:CBDC**
	 - stable as the national currency 
	 - allowed the central bank to control the capital outflows and implied the monetary policy
  ### Interest rate
  - i: nominal interest rate 
  - r: real interest rate
  - fisher equation:
	  - `!$r \approxeq i- \pi^e$` 
	  - relationship between the real inerest rate and nominal interest rate
  - Ex ante
	  - `!$r = i- \pi^e$` 
	  - real interest rate is adjusted for expected changes in the price level
  - Ex post
	  -  `!$r = i- \pi$`
	  -   real interest rate is adjusted for actual changes in the price level
  -   Future value vs. present value
	  -   `!$PV=\frac{Y_t}{(1+i)^t}$`
	  -   `!$PV=\frac{A_1}{(1+i)}+\frac{A_2}{(1+i)^2}+...+\frac{A_t}{(1+i)^t}$` 
	  -   PV < P 不应该买
	  -   PV \> P所有人都买
	  -   PV = P equilibrium
### CREDIT MARKET INSTRUMENTS 
- simple loan
	- the borrower receives from the lender an amount called the principal and agrees to repay the lender the principal plus interest on a specific date when the loan matures.
- [discount bond](#“discount_bond”) 
- [coupon bond](#“coupon”)
- fixed payment loan
	- requires the borrower to make regular periodic payments of principal(本金) and interest（利息） to the lender
 
 ### Efficient market hypothesis 
 - based on rational expectation 
 - the equilibrium price of a security = its fundamental value
 - Why stock price unstable?
	 - **the stock price reflects all available infomaion on their fundamental value, their prices constantly change as news affects fundamental value**
 - **Information is only valuable if it is not pulicly avilable**
 - stock-picking cannot gnerate a higher expected return than the markets as a whole
 - pulic info or pulished reports of investment advisers is already reflected in market prices
 - "hold the market" is the best
 - minimize trading
 - stock price decrease under covid pandamic
	 - if reason of decrease is the decrease of fundamental value(这个公司在疫情期间的运营不行)----》 符合EMH
	 - if the reason is people overreaction , 不符合
 - **Behavior economics**: study of choices that do not appear to be economically rational 
	 - **BUBBLE** : a situation in which the price of an assets rise above the asset's fundamental value
		 - news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person
		 - HERD BEHAVIOUR: investors imitating the behavior of other investors rather
than trading on the basis of fundamental values

### Financial structure
#### Key facts
- as a source of funding for business, financial intermediaries are much more important than financial markets
- The stock markets is less important than the bond market as a source of external funds to corporations 
- Debt contracts usually require collateral（抵押） or restrictive covenants(条款)
- financial intermediates has larger transcation cost than financial market

#### Asymmetric information  
##### Adverse selection 
- infomation issues that arise before the transction 
- lender doesn't know the characteristics of the projet and borrower 
- 无法分辨借债者的还款能力， 只能charge 高风险和低风险的平均利率，导致只有高风险者愿意借贷
- **solution**：
	- increase information
	- force borrowers to have a large stake in the outcome like collateral
	- for fiancial intermediary:
		- relationship banking : 违约了一家，在其他家也借不到钱

##### Moral hazard
- **The borrower's incentives to succeed are weakened by having to repay the lender**
- PRINCIPAL AGENT PROBLEM: managers (the agents) pursuing their own interests rather than those of shareholders (the principals)
- MH in stock market
	-  firms are owned by shareholders but run by top management
	-  thus, the mangers have an incentive to underreposrt profits
		-  reduce the dividends and retain the profit for their own
	-  Solution 
		-  issue financial statements audited by independent accountants
		-  incentive contracts to align the gials of managers with the goals of shareholders
-  MH in bond market
	-  less moral hazard in the bond market than in the stock market
	-  restrictive covenants into bond contracts
-  MH in banks ( too big to fail)
	-  financial firms will make riskier investments if they believe the government will save them from bankruptcy
-  Solution 
	-  monitoring/ screening can be costly 
	-  collateral
	-  shortcoming:
		-   monitoring/screening can be costly 
		-   free-riding 
-   finiancial intermediaries less costly in information than financial market
	-   handling many similar transactions and no free-riding (monoplistic relationship with borrower)
  
#### Banking
- FI must resolve conflicting interests of lenders and borrowers 
- profit from **interest rate spread**
	-  interest rate sprread caused by **asset transformation**

### Bank Management 
- **Bank balance sheet**
	- Assets= liabilities + shareholder's equity
	- 表左右两边相等
	- ![balance sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeyaoLin/econ_note/main/小书匠/1649709560462.png)

	- **Assets** 
		- reserves= settlement balances (deposits at the bank of Canada)+ vault cash
		- loans
		- securities 
		- Cash Items in Process of Collection
			- checks drawn on other bank
		- Deposits at other banks
	- **Liabilities**
		- demand and notice deposits
			- lowest-cost source of funds
		- fixed-term deposits
		- borrowings
			- settlement balances with the bank of Canada 
			- interbank loan 
			- repurchase agreements(repos)
	- **Bank Capital** 
		- = asset- liability  
		- shareholders' equity of a bank(原始资本)
		- Insolvent: bank capital < 0,离倒闭不远了
#### 4 kinds of management
**Asset management, liability management,liquidity, capital adequancy**
##### liquidity management
- maintain enough reserves to satisfy withdraw
- no enough solution :
	- **borrow from other bank** (lowest cost)
	- **sell security**
		- cost include brokerage（佣金）+ other transaction cost
	- **borrow from central bank**
		- interest rate higher than other bank
	- **reduce its loans** (most costly)
 #### capital adequacy 
 - **influences the "safety" of a bank**
	 - bank capital ratio= bank capital/ assets
	 - higher bank capital ratio--> less chance to become insolvent bank 
 - **Influences the returns for the bank’s shareholders or equity holders** 
	 - return on asset 
		 - `!$ROA= \frac{profit }{asset}$`
	 - return on equity
		 -  `!$ROE= \frac{profit }{bank\ capital}$`
		 -  share holders want the highest possible rate of ROE
	 -  **Equity Multiplier(Leverage Ratio)**
		 -   `!$EM= \frac{assets }{bank\ capital}=\frac{1}{CR}$`
		 -    `!$ROE=ROA\times EM$` 
			 -    The higher EM , the higher ROE as ROA constant.
			 -    the higher EM , the lower CR
	  - **Trade off**
		 - increase bank capital will increase CR and reduced EM ,then final reduced the ROE. However, the bank with high ROE attract more investors and depositors
		 - Higher ROE implies a higher risk of bank failure
	 - more competitive  market---> bank has incentive to choose high EM and low CR
	 - MH  
		 -  if payment to managers is based on ROE, managers may take on more risk to generate high ROE
#### regulate bank capital
- why government limits the amount of leverage that banks are allowed?
	- incentive effect
		- highly-capitalized banks less susceptible to moral hazard
	- Stability effect 
		- highly-capitalized banks less vulnerable to loan defaults
- **Capital Adequacy ratio**
	- `!$CAR=\frac{Eligible\ capital}{risk-weighted\ assets}$`
- **off balance sheet activities**
	- examples: loan guarantee,stand by letter of credit
	- increase risk
#### interest rate risk
##### GAP analysis 
- GAP=rate sensitive assets(RSA)- rate sensitive liabilities(RSL)
##### Duration analysis
- risk also could caused by the difference of duration of asset and liability
#### CREDIT RISK
 risk that borrowers might default their loans,main––ly caused by  [asymmetric infomation](#asymmetric20information_15) 
- reduced MH
	- credit rationing : 
		- Loan and credit limits reduce moral hazard by increasing the chance a borrower will repay
	- Relationship banking:
		- Long-term business relationships reveal more information about the borrower 
	- [other method](#moral20hazard_17)
### Financial regulation 
#### Bank panic
- bank run:
	-  all depositors immediately withdraw all their deposits in fear that the bank is about to final
	-  it can be caused by a self-fulfillig prophecy
		-  看见别人取钱，你也取
-  In bank panic, many bank experience runs
-  **Contagion** is the process by which a run on one bank
spreads to other banks, resulting in a bank panic.
- **FEEDBACK LOOP**
	- ![loop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeyaoLin/econ_note/main/小书匠/1649710001892.png)
#### solution 
##### banking holidays 
银行放假不让取钱
##### lender of last resort 

##### deposit insurance 
#####
 
### Crisis 
- occurs when a large siruption in the flow of funds from lenders to borrowers
- result in financial activity declines, then GDP and price level also may decline 
	- crisis--> investment decrease--> GDP decrease
###### regulation Q
- estabilished in 1933
- to limit competition for funds among banks
- prohibited banks from paying interest on demand deposits
- placed ceilings on the interest rates banks pay on time and savings deposits
- **Impact results**
	-  inflation increase
	- nominal interest rate increase
	- credit crunch occurs ,since bank can not improve their interest rate
	- disintermediation occurs
		- the exit of savers and borrowers from banks to financial markets
	- saving and loan crisis occurs (1979-1980)
- Government's regulatory cycle
	- new regulation is a response to crisis, but eventually causes new problems and so the regulation changes or is cancelled
 ###### 08 financial crisis
 - housing bubble 
 - securitization 
	 - 把房屋贷款变成债券(mortgage backed securities)
	 - bank sale their mortgage to a specialized financial institutions, then this institution produces and sells MBS  
	 - MBS 卖给了很多investment bank
 - real effect
	 - GDP decrease, unemployment increase
 - Settlement Policy
	 - reduced SR interest rate target to 0

### Central Bank
- 作用：
	- currency
	- government funds
	- financial system
	- monetary policy
#### 美国央行 VS. 加拿大央行
- federal reserve
- 
#### Money supply process
- balance sheet of central bank
 
| assets                          | liabiliteis                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| securities                      | currency in circulation       |
| loans to financial institutions | reserves(settlement balances) |
- Currency in circulation : in the hands of the public
 ##### reserves
 - reserves: bank's deposits(settlements balance) at the bank of C and vault cash
 - **desired require ratio**: 
	- the fraction of deposits that **the bank want to** keep as reserves
##### Monetary base
`!$MB=C+R$` 
**How to control**
1. [open market operation](#conventional20policy_51)
	1. purchase: MB increase 
	2. sales: MB decrease
2. making loans to banks

`!$M1=cash+ demand\ deposit=MB\times Money\ Multiplier$`
### Monetary Policy
#### Money market model 
  - Money demand
	 - The opportunity cost of holding money equals the nominal interest rate on bonds 
	 - interest rate increase--->cost of holding money increase-->quantity of money demand decrease
	 - factor result in shift
		 - income ↑ demand ↑
		 - price ↑ demand ↑
- Money supply
		 - supply curve is vertical, determined by policy of central bank 
- Monetary equilibrium
	-  ![DS model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeyaoLin/econ_note/main/小书匠/1649712915970.png) 

	-  用于决定interest rate
	-   Double equilibrium
		-   bond market is equilibrium , the money market must also be in equilibrium
##### effect of increasing money supply
- **liquidity effect** (direct effect)
	- money increase, people buying more bonds with extra money 
	- bond demand ↑  price ↑ interest rate ↓
- **indirect effect**
	- changes in money demand 
	- Expected-inflation effect
		  - MS increase--> π_e increase,according to [fisher effect](#interest20rate_10),nominal interest rate increase
	- The price-level effect
		- price level increase--> need more cash for transactions-->MD increase
	- The income effect 
		- MS increase--> consumption increase--> GDP increase
		- interest rate increase --> demand for money increase , bond demand decrease
- **only when liquidity effect dominated the influence,money supply increase,nominal interest rate falls**
	- before the 1981, higher money growth, liquidity effect not dominated
	- after 2000, M2 increase sharply ->data fits the panel with liquidity effect larger than other effect

#### Central bank policy
- overnight market
	- banks adjust their settlement balance by borrowing  and lending reserves
	- standing liquidity facility: borrowing or lending with central bank
	- asset with 24-hour term to maturity
	- overnight interest rate = `!$i_{OR}$` , decided by overnight market D&S
- how to control overnight interest rate(policy rate , target for `!$i_{OR}$` )
	- BofC impose an interest-rate spread on settlement balances by setting bank rate( `!$i_{B}$`) and deposit rate( `!$i_{D}$`)
		- lend money to banks with bank rate 
		- borrow money from banks(bank deposit) with deposit rate
		- ![LVTS settlement balance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeyaoLin/econ_note/main/小书匠/1649718563902.png)
##### full D&S model of overnight market
![ON_D&S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeyaoLin/econ_note/main/小书匠/1649718738837.png)

- Demand:
	- the overnight rate cannot less than deposit rate
	- when overnight rate equals to deposit rate,commercial bank is indifferent between lend to other banks and deposit at central bank.
- Supply:
	- supply of reserves = non-borrowed reserves+ borrowed reserves
	- bank rate exceed overnight rate, commercial bank borrowed money from other banks rather than central bank.
	- if the overnight rate equals to bank rate, the supply of reserves is infinite
- central bank's impact
	- The BofC shift the supply of reserves to control the overnight interest rate by monetary policy 

##### repurchase transactions (repo,reverse repo)
- SPRA:repo: a form of short-term borrowing from deals in government securities 
	- transfer reserves temporarily to the seller
	- **increasing reserves supply temporarily**
	- **decrease overnight rate**
	- the seller is required to re-purchased the bonds a day later at the agreed resale price
- SRA: reverse repo: the BofC sells government of Canada bonds to a buyer
	- **temporarily reducing the reserves**
	-  **increase overnight rate**
##### other policy
- adjust minimum settlement balance per member (调整required ratio)
- transfer of government cash balance between BofC and other LVTS participants
 #### Policy Rule 
 ##### Credibility 
 - **Nominal anchor**: the main goal of monetary policy 
	 - eg. inflation rate ,nominal GDP,size of money supply ,nominal interest rate
	 - Purpose: to provide an anchor for inflationary
expectations.
 - The credibility of central banks influences people's economic decisions.
 ##### policy rule
 - A tool to achieve credibility 
 - policy maker announce in advance how policy will respond in various situations and commit to following through
 - **inflation targeting rule**
	 -  加拿大的货币政策目标是将通货膨胀稳定在2%
	 -  `!$i_{OR}=a+b(\pi-\pi^T)$` , where `!$\pi^T$` is inflation rate target and π is the actual inflation 
	 -  if 
 
#### Monetary policy 
main idea: control the level of economic activity by manipulating the size of the money supply 
assumption: the changes in overnight rate will cause changes in bank lending, so affect credit conditions in other markets( 所有i 都同方向变)
##### conventional policy 
- **open market operation**
	- change short term i or iOR
	- open market purchase 
		- expansionary policy 
		- reduces overnight interest rate
	- open market sale
		- contractionary policy 
		- increase  overnight interest rate

##### non-conventional monetary policy 
when supply intersect with demand flat section, the changes in supply doesn't change the interest rate. 
consist mainly of central bank purchase of long term asset
- **quantitative easing**
	- Expansion of central bank trading to long-term securities
	- 08年金融危机出现的政策工具
	- impact:
		- generated a huge increase in the monetary base
			- shifting reserve supply to right 
		- does not necessarily increase the money supply 
			- bank will not increase the lending during the crisis
	- failure in credit  expansion ,success in stabilizing banks
	- The goal of QE is **credit easing**,which shifts lending from short term to longer term contracts, decreasing the long-term asset's interest rate.
