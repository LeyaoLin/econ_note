        - shocks to borrower's future income 
        - incmplete info about the borrower
    - **liquidity**: ease of converting asset into cashh 
        - trascation cost 
    - **matchng borrowers and lender** 
        - individuals not aware of all possible opptunities for borrowering and lending
        - incomplete info about the borrower
- The solution
    - diversificationn : splitting of wealth among many different assets to reduce risk(鸡蛋不要放在一个篮子里)
    - financial system

### 3. financial market
- primary market : financial markets where stocks, bonds and other securities are sld foor first time.
- secondary market: financial markets where traders buy or sell existinng seccurities（二手市场）
#### bond market
-    a debt security that promises to make payments periodically  fr a specified period of time 
- The price of bond reflect:
    - the value of promise payments
    - the probability that payments will actually be made 
- interest rate features
    - short-term bonds / safer bonds have low interest rates
    - the spreads between them fluctuate
- <span id=“discount_bond”><b>Discount bond</b> </span>
    - debt instrument
    - present value < future value
    - single payment at maturity 
- <span id=“coupon”><b>Coupon bond</b> </span>
    - debt instrument
    - multiple payments bond 
    - Coupon: the annual fixed dollar amount of interest paid by the issuer of the bod to the buyer
    - `!$ coupon \  rate=\frac{coupon}{Face \ value} $`
- **Yield of Maturity** 
	- 债卷的整体年均回报率,中途没有转卖
	- let PV= Price
	- yield < 市场利率 →不应该投资
	- One year discount bond :
		- `!$\frac{F}{1+i}=P$`
		- i: discount yield to matiurity 
		- F : face value 
		- P : current price  of the discount bond
		- `!$i=\frac{F}{P}-1=\frac{F-P}{P}$`
		-  i and bond price have negative relationship
	-  Coupon bonds
		-   `!$General \ price= \sum_1^T \frac{coupon}{(1+i)^T}+\frac{F}{(1+i)^T} $` 
		-   coupon bond price 
			-   = face value , the YTM = coupon rate
			-   < face value, the YTM > coupon rate
			-   \> face value, the YTM < coupon rate 
-   **risk** 
	-    interest-rate risk 
		-    financial asset 价格波动的risk
	-    default risk
		-  不还钱的风险
		-  gov. bond default risk < firm bond default risk
-  **rate of return**
	-  投资一年的回报
	-  one period discount bond without default risk
		-  `!$R= \frac{F-P}{P}=YTM$`
			-  没有interest rate risk
	-  Multi period bond 
		-  multi period coupon bond return= the coupon + the resale price of  the bond next year
		-  价格变动产生的利润/损失： capital gain/loss
		-  realized capital gain / loss : 债券卖出之后
		-  `!$Rate \ of  \ return = Currennt\ yield + rate\ of\ capital\ gain$`
		-  `!$R= \frac{coupon}{price}+\frac{P_{t+1}-P_t}{P_t}$`
-  **Bond market equilibrium**
	-  Demand side 
		-  factors affect demand
			-   Wealth (+)
			-   Expected return(+)
			-   Risk (-)
			-   Liquidity(+)
			-   international capital inflows(+)
			-   expected inflation(-)(at start point)
		-   The price and quantity demanded are **negatively** related 
			-   reason: **asset returns are reduced by higher asset prices**
	-  Supply side 
		-  determinded in primary market 
		-  factor affect supply
			-  Gov. budget deficit (+)
			   budget deficit→ gov need borrow →supply ↑
			-  Investment opportunities(+)
			  economic growth/expansion →公司做项目机会多→借钱投资
			  → supply↑
			-  Expected real cost of borrowing (-)
				-  π_e increase, 在初期，i constant，real interest  rate decrease
				-  借钱成本下降→多借钱
			-  international capital flows(+),海外机构借钱
		-  the price and the quantity are **positive** related because **the cost of funds is reduced by higher asset prices**
-  **interest rate decrease during the recessions**
	-  econnomic downturn`!$\rightarrow$` expected income `!$\downarrow$` ,wealth `!$\downarrow$` `!$\rightarrow$` demand shift left,price decrease
	-  supply shift right: lower expectd productivity --> profit decrease--> bond price rise
	-  `!$\Delta D < \Delta S$`
	-  bond price rise in a recession 
-  interest rate prdict inflation 
	-  `!$\pi_e \uparrow$` --> at start point ,D &S don't change, r decrease, i constant
	-   then,demand cure shift to left,supply curve shift to right
	-  after that, P decrease, i increase
-  **Fisher effect**
	-  `!$r \approxeq i- \pi^e$` 
		-  assume r is fixed ,then change in nominal interest rate must match exactly any changes in the expected inflation rate
	-  Higher  **expected inflation rates**  --> higher nominal interest rates 
	-  changes in epected inflation rates--> chages in nomical interest rates **before a change in actual inflation occurs** 
#### stock market
- a share of ownership in a corporation 
- the price of stock reflects he current value of the corporation
- common stock 
    - entitles the owner to a vote at share-holder meetings of the corporation

- stock trading 
    - stock exchange 
    - over the counter market
    - IPO: 上市
- **share value**
	- `!$r_E$`: required  rate of return 
		- 最低的投资股票回报率
		- equity cost of capital
		- `!$re=present\ value + equity\ premium$` 
		- equity premium: 股票回报率 - other  asset  return rate 
		- why stock have hiher return rate?
			- stock has **systematic risk**
				- 股票市场的巨大波动
			-  stock has **Idiosyncratic risk**
				-  公司自己的风险（公共危机,etc.）
- **Stock Value**
	- `!$D^e_{t+1}$` = the dividend paid ar the end of year 1
	- `!$P^e_{t+1}$`= the resale price  at the end of year 1
	- stock current price : `!$P_t=\frac{D_{t+1}^e}{1+r_E}+\frac{P_{t+1}^e}{1+r_E}$`
	- `!$R=r_E=$` the ecpected rate of return
	- `!$\frac{D^e_{t+1}}{P_t}$` :dividend yield
	- Fundamental value of a stock （一直持有）
	   `!$P_t=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{D_{t+k}}{(1+r_E)^k}$`
	- Gorden growth model
		-  assume stock's dividend increase at growth rate **g**
		-  `!$P_t= D_{t+k} \times \frac{1+g}{(r_E-g)}$`
-  **models of expectations** 
		-  `!$P_{t+1}=P^e_{t+1}+ \epsilon_{t+1}$`
		-  Adaptive expectations 
			-  expectations are based on past experience only
			-  slow to adjust to news
		-  Rational expectations
			-  expectations are based on all available information
			-  **instantaneous adjustment** to reliable news about future trends
### Money

		- M2+\+: M2+ + certain retail debt instruments
		- M3:M2+ non-personal term deposits + foreign currency bank deposits
	- In SR, M1 and M2 can mover in different direction.
		- variation over time in d&S of each type of financial asset 
		- a rise in interest-rate spreads raise the relative cost of hoding asset that are less liquid, risker or longer-term
	- in LR, these aggregates tend to move in same direction

  ### Interest rate
  - i: nominal interest rate 
  - r: real interest rate
  - fisher equation:
	  - `!$r \approxeq i- \pi^e$` 
	  - relationship between the real inerest rate and nominal interest rate
  - Ex ante
	  - `!$r = i- \pi^e$` 
	  - real interest rate is adjusted for expected changes in the price level
  - Ex post
	  -  `!$r = i- \pi$`
	  -   real interest rate is adjusted for actual changes in the price level
  -   Future value vs. present value
	  -   `!$PV=\frac{Y_t}{(1+i)^t}$`
	  -   `!$PV=\frac{A_1}{(1+i)}+\frac{A_2}{(1+i)^2}+...+\frac{A_t}{(1+i)^t}$` 
	  -   PV < P 不应该买
	  -   PV \> P所有人都买
	  -   PV = P equilibrium
### CREDIT MARKET INSTRUMENTS 
- simple loan
	- the borrower receives from the lender an amount called the principal and agrees to repay the lender the principal plus interest on a specific date when the loan matures.
- [discount bond](#“discount_bond”) 
- [coupon bond](#“coupon”)
- fixed payment loan
	- requires the borrower to make regular periodic payments of principal(本金) and interest（利息） to the lender
 
 ### Efficient market hypothesis 
 - based on rational expectation 
 -
